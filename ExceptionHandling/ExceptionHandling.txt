Exception handling is a mechanism used in programming to manage errors and other exceptional events. It allows the normal flow of a program to continue or terminate gracefully. It typically involves using constructs like try, except, and finally to catch exceptions, handle them appropriately, and ensure resources are released properly.

Common Scenarios Leading to Exceptions
1. Null Pointer Exceptions
This is a very common one. A NullPointerException (NPE) occurs when you try to use an object that hasn't been initialized yet—kind of like trying to use a car that doesn’t have an engine! For example:

String name = null;
System.out.println(name.length()); // Throws NullPointerException
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Array Index Out of Bounds
Arrays in Java have fixed lengths, just like the number of seats in a train. If you try to access an index outside that range, Java will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. It’s like trying to sit in a seat that isn't there.

int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println(numbers[3]); // Throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Arithmetic Exceptions
Math is great, but not every operation is allowed—even in Java. If you try to divide by zero, for example, you'll get an ArithmeticException.

int result = 10 / 0; // Throws ArithmeticException: / by zero
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Class Cast Exceptions
Casting in Java can be useful, but it can lead to problems if you're not careful. When you try to cast an object to a class it doesn’t belong to, you’ll get a ClassCastException.

Object obj = new Integer(100);
String str = (String) obj; // Throws ClassCastException
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Number Format Exceptions
Have you ever tried converting a word into a number? Java will throw a NumberFormatException if you try to turn non-numeric text into a number.

String value = "abc";
int number = Integer.parseInt(value); // Throws NumberFormatException
