Interviewer: What is a PriorityQueue in Java?

Ideal Answer: A PriorityQueue in Java is a type of queue where each element is assigned a priority. Elements with higher priority are processed before those with lower priority, regardless of their order of arrival. It is part of the java.util package and uses a heap-based implementation to efficiently manage element priorities.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interviewer: What are the basic operations you can perform with a PriorityQueue?

Ideal Answer: The basic operations you can perform with a PriorityQueue are:

Adding elements using the add(E element) or offer(E element) methods.
Removing elements using the remove() or poll() methods.
Viewing the highest-priority element without removing it using the peek() method
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interviewer: What is the internal data structure used by a PriorityQueue in Java?

Ideal Answer: The internal data structure used by a PriorityQueue in Java is a heap. Specifically, it uses a binary heap, which allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements while maintaining the priority order
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interviewer: What are some common use cases for a PriorityQueue in computer science?

Ideal Answer: Common use cases for a PriorityQueue in computer science include task scheduling, where tasks with higher priority need to be executed first; Dijkstra's algorithm, for finding the shortest path in a graph by repeatedly selecting the node with the smallest distance; and event management systems, where events are processed based on their priority.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interviewer: Explain the difference between the add() and offer() methods in a PriorityQueue.

Ideal Answer: Both add() and offer() methods are used to insert elements into a PriorityQueue. The primary difference is in their handling of capacity constraints. The add() method throws an IllegalStateException if the queue is full, while the offer() method returns false in such a case, providing a more graceful way to handle capacity limits.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interviewer: What is the time complexity of inserting and removing elements in a PriorityQueue?

Ideal Answer: The time complexity of both inserting and removing elements in a PriorityQueue is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the queue. This efficiency is due to the underlying heap-based implementation, which allows for quick adjustments to maintain the priority order.

Basic Operations with PriorityQueue
Let’s look at how to use PriorityQueue in Java for managing tasks effectively.

1. Adding Elements
Method: add(E element) or offer(E element)

Purpose: Adds an element to the queue based on its priority.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Removing Elements
Method: remove() or poll()

Purpose: Removes and returns the highest-priority element from the queue.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peek (Viewing the Highest-Priority Element)
Method: peek()

Purpose: Views, but does not remove, the highest-priority element in the queue
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use Cases for PriorityQueue
1. Task Scheduling
If you’re managing tasks with varying levels of urgency, PriorityQueue is the perfect tool to ensure that important tasks get priority. Imagine running a hospital emergency room—some patients need attention faster than others based on their condition, and PriorityQueue helps make those decisions.

2. Dijkstra's Algorithm
In computer science, PriorityQueue is often used in graph algorithms like Dijkstra's Algorithm, where you need to pick the node with the shortest distance repeatedly to find the optimal path.

3. Event Management
In event-driven systems, PriorityQueue can be used to process events based on their priority, ensuring that critical events are addressed first while lower-priority events wait in line.
