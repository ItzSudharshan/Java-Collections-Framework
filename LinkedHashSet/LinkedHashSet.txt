A LinkedHashSet is a part of Java's Collections Framework. It is similar to a HashSet, but with a key difference: it maintains the order of elements based on their insertion. This means that a LinkedHashSet keeps a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries, preserving the order in which elements are added. This feature makes it useful when we need a set that maintains insertion order, while still having the benefits of a set like preventing duplicates

Common Operations with LinkedHashSet in App Development
1. Adding Elements
Method: add(E element)

Purpose: Adds an element to the set if it doesn’t already exist while maintaining the insertion order.

Real-World Example: Suppose a user adds different courses to their learning dashboard in the Kodnest app. LinkedHashSet makes sure every course is listed only once, in the order the user added them.

2. Removing Elements
Method: remove(Object o)

Purpose: Removes the specified element if it exists.

Real-World Example: If a user decides to remove a course from their learning list, LinkedHashSet allows this action without affecting the order of the remaining courses.

3. Checking for Elements
Method: contains(Object o)

Purpose: Checks if the LinkedHashSet contains a specific element.

Real-World Example: This could be used in Kodnest to verify if a specific course is already added to the user’s learning plan.

4. Iterating Through Elements
Method: Use an iterator or an enhanced for loop.

Purpose: Allows you to access each element in the same order they were added.

Real-World Example: Suppose you want to display a list of all courses added by a user in the order they were added—LinkedHashSet makes this easy.

Where to Use LinkedHashSet in App Development
1. User Activity Logs
When tracking user activity in an app like Kodnest, it’s important to know both what users have done and in which order they did it. LinkedHashSet ensures each activity is unique but keeps the sequence intact for easier playback or analysis.

2. Managing User Preferences
Suppose a user has the option to mark their favorite courses or resources. You’d want these to be listed in the order they were added without any repeats. Using LinkedHashSet makes this simple to implement.

3. Session Management
In some applications, maintaining the order of user sessions while ensuring no duplicate session is tracked is critical. LinkedHashSet is a good fit for such scenarios, especially if sessions need to be displayed in the order they were initiated.

4. Recently Viewed Items
For an e-learning platform, keeping track of the recently viewed items by a user helps to enhance the user experience. With LinkedHashSet, you can maintain this list efficiently without duplicates and in the order of viewing.
